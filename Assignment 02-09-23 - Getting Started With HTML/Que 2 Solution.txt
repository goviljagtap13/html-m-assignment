2.2. Explain the purpose of comments in HTML and provide an example of how to use comments in an HTML
document.

Solution:

Comments are sections of text that are not rendered by the web browser. 
They are used to explain the code, which can help you when you edit the source code at a 
later date. This is especially useful if you have a lot of code.Comments are ignored by 
browsers and do not affect the rendering of the
webpage.
example

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>My Website</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
<!-- <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p> -->
</body>
<!-- ADD more information here Later -->
</html>


In first comment <!--  --> this tag is used as comment , if u reomve <!-- and --> between <p>
tag The line will rendered on browser.

In second comment remineder is given to add additional infromaion on later, such as adding 
more content on webpage.
