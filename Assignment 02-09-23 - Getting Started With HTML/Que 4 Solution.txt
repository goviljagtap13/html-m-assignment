4. Write a short note on Tag and element with an example.
Solution:

Tags:
Tags are the symbols used to mark up the start and end of an HTML element. They appear in 
pairs, enclosed within angle brackets (< >). For instance, the <p> tag indicates the
beginning of a paragraph, and its corresponding closing tag, </p>, marks the end. Tags 
provide the framework for structuring a web page's content.


Element:

Elements, represent the actual content defined by the tags. They 
encompass the text, images, or other media enclosed within the tag pair. Elements 
encapsulate the meaningful units that make up a web page's structure and presentation.

<p>this paragramph is lorem</p>

In this case, the <p> tag marks the start of the element, while the closing tag, </p>, 
marks the end. The text, "This is a paragraph of lorem," is the element itself, the actual 
content defined by the <p> tag.
