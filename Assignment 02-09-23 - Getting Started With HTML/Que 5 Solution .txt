5. What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML?
Solution:

The DOCTYPE Declaration, short for Document Type Declaration, is a crucial component of an 
HTML document. It informs the web browser about the version of HTML being used, enabling 
the browser to render the page correctly and consistently across different platforms. 
The DOCTYPE Declaration appears as the very first line of an HTML document, even before 
the <html> tag.
